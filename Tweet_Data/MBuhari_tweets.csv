557108744942014464,2015-01-19 09:34:10,Imagine the accelerated growth we can now achieve in a democracy which the world has seen to be the most effective way of governing nations
557108214677139457,2015-01-19 09:32:03,We are lucky to have in this election two people who have led this country. I am proud to present our record of solutions and effectiveness.
557108056581210113,2015-01-19 09:31:25,We have presented our vision and plans  through our manifesto (available on http://t.co/mpQkYuVlSg) and our town hall meetings.
557107912502296576,2015-01-19 09:30:51,"We have only presented our record  how we fought insurgencies, how we stabilised the naira, how we tackled corruption."
557107789256859648,2015-01-19 09:30:22,Can our president keep us safe when we travel to any part of this country? Is your life better today than it was six years ago?
557107524038430720,2015-01-19 09:29:18,Do our children find it easy to get jobs? Do our sisters and brothers find it easy to set up and sustain their businesses?
557107074291597312,2015-01-19 09:27:31,We are concerned only about his record  has he secured Nigeria? Has he fought corruption? Has he truly grown the economy so it can work?
557106314610868224,2015-01-19 09:24:30,"We have not spoken about the President's family, his health, his religion, his ethnic group, or his phone number."
557106127566303232,2015-01-19 09:23:46,We do not have a disinformation or propaganda wing in our campaign. We have no need to waste time in driving petty attacks.
557106035425419265,2015-01-19 09:23:24,Our President and his allies must remember that he is not only a candidate for office; he is the President of Nigeria.
557105208258342912,2015-01-19 09:20:06,We should be deeply worried that a President who called for calm during governorship elections has now lost his cool in his own elections.
557104357163139072,2015-01-19 09:16:43,"Where is his fabled calm, where is his reserve, where is his composure? Why is he so ruffled? Why is he so frustrated and afraid?"
557103734002831360,2015-01-19 09:14:15,How can a President who has led this country for six years be unable to run on his own record and his achievements?
557103514921754624,2015-01-19 09:13:23,"How can his campaign be talking about dead ex-leaders, jogging around the stadium and outright lies about my health?"
557103371342319617,2015-01-19 09:12:48,How can the President of this country be talking about remembering phone numbers and coup speeches?
557103274994982912,2015-01-19 09:12:25,"All of us, citizens and voters need to ask ourselves  why is our President so desperate?"
557103146888347648,2015-01-19 09:11:55,What is this obsession with lies? What is this obsession with pettiness? What is this obsession with threats and attacks?
557103069625077760,2015-01-19 09:11:36,The desperation is beyond my understanding. #ThingsMustChange
557102168826593280,2015-01-19 09:08:02,This campaign should be about those issues. It should be about today and the future; about securing Nigerian lives and Nigerian land.
557101732585418753,2015-01-19 09:06:18,The businesses of our enterprising youth are being killed by lack of access to finance and poor economic policies.
557101409665961985,2015-01-19 09:05:01,"Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Nigerians died in #Baga days ago. Our unemployment numbers are rising."
557101189305610241,2015-01-19 09:04:08,"It is a tragedy to see the ruling party focus on pettiness and lies; rumours of cancer, foreign treatment, and certificates they know exist."
557100968777498624,2015-01-19 09:03:16,"Why should candidates tell so many frantic lies in order to win elections, if truly their purpose is to transform the lives of our people?"
557100782353252352,2015-01-19 09:02:31,"I have run for office before, but I have consistently done so without desperation or anger, because elections are not war."
557100601293537280,2015-01-19 09:01:48,"I clearly underrated the panic and lack of integrity that leads people to tell barefaced lies, and must confess, it continues to confound me"
557100452790018048,2015-01-19 09:01:13,I have become seriously disturbed by the volume of falsehood and desperation from the opposition campaign of the PDP.
